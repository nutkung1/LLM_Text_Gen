[Q] What is the Optimist NFT?

With the Optimist NFT, you have the power to create a one-of-a-kind avatar that represents your unique personality and interests. The vision is that this NFT represents you as an individual Optimist, and evolves to reflect your identity and reputation across the city as you interact with different projects and protocols.
